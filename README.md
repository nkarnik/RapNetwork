#RapNetwork
---------------
My inspiration for and explanation of this app is [at this blog post here](http://nikhilkarnik.com/articles/lil-wayne-pagerank-1/). This zillabyte app is designed to crawl and scrape data from rap lyrics site. Stores lyrics and song metadata for building a graph of artist collaborations with networkx.

Also handles visualization of the full graph, connected subgraph, and minimum spanning tree.
